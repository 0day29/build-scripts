Outdated GLIBC version
----------------------

This package is self-contained but it does need certain basic dependencies like libc.
If you haven't updated your system for a while you may see the following message:

    ruby: /lib/libc.so.6: version GLIBC_2.14' not found

If you do get this error please update your system and try again.
